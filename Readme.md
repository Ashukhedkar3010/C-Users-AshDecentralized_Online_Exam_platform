REDME: Dcentralized Online Exam Platform

Introduction
The Decentralized Online Exam Platform is a secure and transparent system built using blockchain technology to administer exams online. The platform allows educational institutions to conduct exams in a fair and tamper-proof environment, leveraging the immutability and transparency of blockchain. It ensures that exam data such as question papers, student responses, and results are securely stored and can be accessed only by authorized participants.
Key features of the platform:
•	Decentralization: Powered by blockchain to eliminate any central authority or intermediary.
•	Security: Data integrity and confidentiality are ensured using cryptographic techniques.
•	Transparency: The use of blockchain ensures that the data is immutable and transparent for authorized users.
•	Authentication: Identity verification of students and examiners through blockchain-based mechanisms.
Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the traditional online exam system by providing a fully decentralized, secure, and transparent platform using blockchain technology. We aim to eliminate the risks of cheating, data manipulation, and identity fraud while improving the overall examination process.
Future Goals
•	Smart Contracts: Implement smart contracts to automate the grading process and ensure tamper-proof results.
•	Enhanced Security: Integrate facial recognition or biometric authentication for further security in identity verification.
•	Scalability: Expand the platform to support a larger number of users and examiners without compromising performance.
•	Mobile App Integration: Develop mobile applications for students and examiners to interact with the platform more easily.
•	Global Reach: Enable a global platform for conducting exams for various educational sectors, including certifications, school exams, and university tests.
